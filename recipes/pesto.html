         <h2>Creamy pesto spaghetti recipe</h3>
         <p>Here's the trick to getting the creamiest pesto spaghetti evenly covered in silky sauce! Make it with homemade or purchased basil pesto for a fast dinner.</p>

         <h3>Ingredients</h3>
         <ul>
          <li>12 ounces spaghetti or bucatini pasta</li>
          <li>1/2 to 2/3 cup basil pesto</li>
          <li>1/2 cup pasta water, plus more as needed</li>
          <li>Kosher salt</li>
          <li>1 large handful fresh basil leaves, to garnish (optional)</li>
          <li>Parmesan cheese, to garnish (optional)</li>
         </ul>

         <h3>Instructions</h3>
         <ol>
          <li>Start a pot of well salted water to a boil. Boil the pasta until it is just al dente (start tasting a few minutes before the package recommends: you want it to be tender but still a little firm on the inside; usually around 7 to 8 minutes). Just before draining, reserve 1 cup pasta water! Then drain the pasta.</li>
          <li>Place the pasta in a bowl (not the pasta pot). Stir together the pasta, pesto, and 1/2 cup pasta water, tossing with tongs until the pesto is well distributed and the pasta water forms a creamy sauce. Add more pasta water if desired. Stir in 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt and taste. If the flavor doesn't pop, add a few more pinches until it does (the salt content in purchased pesto brands varies, as well as the amount of salt you used in the pasta water). Serve immediately.</li>
          <li>Store any leftovers refrigerated: note that pesto can get gummy when reheated, so it's best to eat leftovers cold or room temp.</li>
